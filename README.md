#QUIZ-RT

A collaborative project to create a real time quiz with multiple users. Project uses Sparql over Wikidata to retrieve information. A Question Generator module that uses Sparql query language for node-based querying to fetch information from Wikidata about a topic or noun. User supplies a query string that is sent to Compromise NLP library to extract topics (if available, else returns nouns). Sparql queries are used to fetch information about a topic and then to fetch data about all nodes related to type of passed topic. Configuration is used to determine question template and ensure randomness in questions and order of questions. Firebase database is used for persisting questions and Firebase login for managing login with Google account and authorizations. Server component behind Express routes to interact with CORS protected Wikidata endpoints. Question Generation and persistence is done on server side. Webpack is used for app bundling and Concurrently is used to run express and webpack-dev-server. Google-trends API is added to generate questions related to famous topics, and question tags are added that can be used to retrieve questions based on tags like country, employment etc.
